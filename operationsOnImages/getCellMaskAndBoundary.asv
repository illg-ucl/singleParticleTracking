function [SignalMask CellBoundaryMask] = getCellMaskAndBoundary(frame)
%
% isa: August 2011.
% Use correlation of an image with a small gaussian mask and gradient to
% obtain a mask with ones at cell positions and zeros in background
% (SignalMask, binary image), and the CellBoundaryMask which is another
% binary image with ones at cell boundaries and zeroes everywhere else.
%
% Inputs: "frame" is the input image. It must have values between 0 and 1.
% IMPORTANT NOTE: Input image frame must have values between 0 and 1. 
% Use mat2gray(frame) instead of frame if values are not between 0 and 1.
% IMPORTANT NOTE: input image is a full image (is then split in top and bottom channels...)
%
% Note: functions "dftcorr" and "imgrad" can be found in
% C:\Isabel\myMatlabFiles.
wcorr = fspecial('gaussian',10,5); % builds Gaussian mask of size 10 by 10 and sigma equal to 5 pixels.
% Note that it is better if the size of the wcorr matrix is an even number (for later).
gcorr = dftcorr(frame,wcorr); % dftcorr calculates the correlation of the image with the mask 
% (it finds places in the image frame which match the mask wcorr).

% Middle row in image that separates top half (red channel) from bottom
% half (green channel). If the image is 512x512, half = 256.
half = round(size(frame,2)/2); % round takes care of sizes in pixels which are odd numbers.
whole = size(frame,2)/2; % full vertical size

% To separate foreground and background we threshold the correlation image:
% Threshold top and bottom independently:
sigBWtop = im2bw(gcorr(1:half,:),graythresh(gcorr(1:half,:))); % thresholding the top half
sigBWbottom = im2bw(gcorr(half+1:2*half,:),graythresh(gcorr(half+1:2*half,:))); % thresholding the bottom half
% Join top and bottom thresholded images into a single image of the original size:
gBW = [sigBWtop; sigBWbottom]; % thresholded correlation image.
gBW2 = circshift(gBW,[round(size(wcorr,1)/2) round(size(wcorr,2)/2)]); % This shifts the image down and to the right by half the size of the mask wcorr.
% The shifting is necessary because the correlation image gives the
% positions of the elements that mask the match as the top left corner
% position of the mask.

% This is the first function output:
SignalMask = gBW2; % This is the foreground (or signal) mask with ones inside cells and zeros in background. It is a binary image.

% Now obtain cell boundaries:
SignalMask2 = mat2gray(SignalMask); % First need to convert binary SignalMask to a grayscale image to be able to apply gradient.
cellBoundaries = imgrad(SignalMask2); % Grayscale image with cell boundaries.
cellBoundaries2 = im2bw(cellBoundaries); % Convert cellBoundaries to a binary image with ones at cell edges or boundaries.
CellBoundaryMask = cellBoundaries2; % This is the second function output.
